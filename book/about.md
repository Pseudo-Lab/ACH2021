# **About Pseudo Lab**

Pseudo Lab is a non-profit community of data scientists and data science students in Korea, centered on machine learning research and providing opportunities for aspiring individuals to progress their career into data science.

At Pseudo Lab, you can do free and trivial research and activities that you can't do at work. We hope to create the value of sharing through open source projects and organizing studies, hackathons, Kaggle-related events, and other events at no cost.
